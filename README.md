# calculator

Done for my DevIsland students as part of the Odin Project

Add, subract, multiply, and divide.
Supports decimals and rolling calculations (e.g. 1+2\*4/3).

I developed a very long regex to limit the input possibilities (e.g. disallowing more than one decimal in a row and leading operators except for "-", etc.). I usually like to steer clear of these but in this case I think it simpflied my code quite a bit.
